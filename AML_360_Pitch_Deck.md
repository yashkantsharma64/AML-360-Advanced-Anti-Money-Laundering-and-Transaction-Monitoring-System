## Slide 1: Problem Statement

### 🚨 The Global Money Laundering Crisis

**The Challenge:**
- **$2.8 Trillion** laundered annually worldwide (UNODC)
- **Only 0.1%** of illicit funds are detected and frozen
- **$1.6 Trillion** in suspicious transactions go undetected each year
- **Traditional AML systems** have 95% false positive rates
- **Manual review processes** are time-consuming and error-prone

**Current Pain Points:**
- ❌ **Rule-based systems** miss sophisticated patterns
- ❌ **High false positive rates** overwhelm compliance teams
- ❌ **Manual processes** are slow and inconsistent
- ❌ **Limited analytics** provide poor insights
- ❌ **Fragmented systems** lack integration
- ❌ **Regulatory compliance** is complex and costly

**Impact on Financial Institutions:**
- 💸 **$200B+** in fines for AML violations (2010-2020)
- 📉 **Reputation damage** from compliance failures
- ⏰ **Operational inefficiencies** in transaction monitoring
- 🔒 **Regulatory pressure** for better AML controls
