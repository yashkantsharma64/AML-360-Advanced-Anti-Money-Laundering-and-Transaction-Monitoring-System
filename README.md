### ðŸŽ¯ Risk Scoring Rules
1. **High-Risk Country Check** (Score: 2-10)
   - Level 1: 2 points (Low-risk countries)
   - Level 2: 4 points (Medium-risk countries)  
   - Level 3: 10 points (High-risk countries)

2. **Suspicious Keywords** (Score: 3)
   - Detects 80+ suspicious keywords in payment instructions
   - Includes crypto, offshore, structuring, and fraud-related terms

3. **High Amount Transactions** (Score: 3)
   - Flags transactions over $1 million USD

4. **Structuring Detection** (Score: 5)
   - Identifies amounts in $8,000-$9,999 range (potential structuring)

5. **Rounded Amounts** (Score: 2)
   - Flags suspiciously round amounts (e.g., $1,000,000, $500,000)

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features
- **Transaction Volume Analysis**: Suspicious vs Normal transactions
- **Country Risk Heatmap**: Visual risk assessment by country
- **Keyword Analysis**: Top suspicious keywords detected
- **Time Series Trends**: Transaction patterns over time
- **Risk Factor Breakdown**: Detailed rule analysis per transaction

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **Data Processing**: PapaParse for CSV handling
- **API Integration**: ExchangeRate-API for currency conversion
- **Storage**: LocalStorage (can be replaced with database)

2. Upload CSV file with transaction data
3. System processes transactions in batches
4. View summary of processed transactions

### Transaction Monitoring
1. View all transactions in the transaction list
2. Filter by risk level, status, or search terms
3. Click "View Details" for comprehensive risk analysis
4. Monitor trends in the main dashboard

## API Integration

### Exchange Rate API
- **Provider**: ExchangeRate-API
- **API Key**: Configured in `lib/aml-engine.js`
- **Usage**: Real-time currency conversion to USD
- **Caching**: Built-in rate caching to minimize API calls

### Risk Data Sources
- **Suspicious Keywords**: Comprehensive list of 80+ AML-related terms
- **Country Risk Levels**: 3-tier risk classification system
- **Rule Engine**: Configurable scoring system

## Configuration

### Exchange Rate API Key
Update the API key in `lib/aml-engine.js`:
```javascript
const exchangeAPI = new ExchangeRateAPI('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

### Risk Rules
Modify risk scoring rules in `lib/aml-engine.js`:
- Adjust score thresholds
- Add new risk rules
- Modify country risk levels
- Update suspicious keywords list

## Data Storage

Currently uses LocalStorage for data persistence. To integrate with a database:

1. Replace `TransactionDatabase` class in `lib/aml-engine.js`
2. Implement database connection and CRUD operations
3. Update API endpoints for data retrieval

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Protection**: Store API keys securely
- **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption for sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Add authentication and authorization
- **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Add API rate limiting

## Performance Optimization

- **Batch Processing**: CSV uploads processed in batches
- **API Caching**: Exchange rates cached to reduce API calls
- **Lazy Loading**: Charts and components loaded on demand
- **Data Pagination**: Large datasets paginated for performance

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: ML-based anomaly detection
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live transaction monitoring
- **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive risk modeling
- **Mobile App**: React Native mobile application
- **API Integration**: Connect to external AML databases
- **Reporting**: Automated compliance reporting
